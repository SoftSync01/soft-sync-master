## Setup Details

SoftSync runs on React & Tailwindcss. Do ensure you have NPM and Node.js installed in your system. If you have not, you may do so on the Node.js website or [https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer](here).\
\
To ensure you have NPM & Node.js downloaded on your system, you can run the following code to check if you have it properly downloaded. It should show the version installed in your system.
```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Project Setup

```
npm install
```
This setups all of the dependency and setups your system for the system.

### Compilation and Development

```
npm run dev
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
A link to your website will be displayed in the terminal bar.\
A sample link will be [http://localhost:5176](http://localhost:5176). Access the link in your browser and the application will launch.

Any changes made and saved will be updated realtime on the website.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
